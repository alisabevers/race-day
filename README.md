# Race Day

## Description
This is a mini-project provided by CodeCademy. The annual race is coming up, and I was tasked to write a program to register the runners and provide them instructions for the race day.

There are 3 different conditions for the runner; therefore, 3 condition code blocks to account for each. There is one to account for whether the runner is under age (18 years old). Another condition is whether the runner is of age and registered early, and lastly, whether the runner is of age but did not register early.

## Instructions
After cloning this repo, you may reassign the values for the variables 'isEarly' and 'age' to match your criteria. Then run ```node main.js``` in your terminal. Depending on the critera which you met, your specific instructions will render in the terminal.
